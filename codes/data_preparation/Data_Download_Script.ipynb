solitary adrenal metastasis from NSCLC and discuss its therapeutic role . METHODS <pop> From June 1993 to March 2003 , 14 patients ( pts ) , who had been undergone <int> lung resection </int> for NSCLC , with suspected or confirmed solitary adrenal gl and metastasis at the follow-up , underwent <int> 15 laparoscopic adrenalectomy </int> ( in 1 patient it was bilateral ) . </pop> All the <pop> patients had enlarged adrenal gl and s at </pop> the <pop> abdominal <int> ultrasound </int> or CT </pop> . All but <pop> 2 pts underwent </pop> at least 1 <int> adrenal <pop> fine </pop> needle aspiration . </int> All the patients underwent a careful staging to exclude other sites of metastasis . The adrenal gl and was in 6 cases the right , in 9 cases the left . RESULTS In 7 cases we had a preoperative <out> cytological diagnosis </out> of metastasis . In 1 case adrenalectomy was not performed because of infiltration of vena cava and in 1 case it was necessary to perform a small laparotomy because of bleeding <out> . </out> The pathologic examination confirmed in 11 cases a NSCLC metastasis while in 4 cases it was a cortical adenoma .

There were 19 men and 4 women , with a mean age of 54 + /- 10 years . </pop> The diagnosis of adrenal metastasis was synchronous with the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer in 6 patients and metachronous in 17 patients . The <out> median disease-free interval </out> for patients with metachronous metastasis was 12.5 months ( range , 4.5 - 60.1 months ) . RESULTS The overall <out> 5-year survival </out> was 23.3 % .

Use of <int> PORT </int> was recommended for pN+ disease but was not r and omized or m and atory . Each center decided whether to use <int> PORT </int> before initiation of the study .

In univariate analysis , <int> PORT </int> had a deleterious effect on <out> the overall population survival . </out> Patients with pN1 disease had an improved <out> survival </out> from <int> PORT </int> in the observation arm ( median survival [ MS ] 25.9 vs. 50.2 months ) , whereas <int> PORT </int> had a detrimental effect in the chemotherapy group ( MS 93.6 months and 46.6 months ) .

patient survival has not yet been established . METHODS <pop> Between January 1994 and January 1999 , 1209 patients with stage I , II , or IIIA NSCLC </pop> were <pop> r and omly </pop> assigned to receive <int> mitomycin C </int> ( 8 mg/m2 on day 1 ) , <int> vindesine </int> ( 3 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) , and <int> cisplatin </int> ( 100 mg/m2 on day 1 ) every 3 weeks for three <int> cycles ( MVP </int> group ; n = 606 ) or <int> no treatment </int> ( <int> control </int> group ; n = 603 ) after <int> complete resection </int> . R and omization was stratified by investigational center , tumor size , lymph-node involvement , and the intention to perform radiotherapy . The primary endpoint was <out> overall survival </out> and secondary endpoints were <out> progression-free survival and toxicity associated with adjuvant treatment . Survival curves </out> were analyzed using the log-rank test . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS After a median follow-up time of 64.5 months , there was no statistically significant difference between the two patient groups in <out> overall survival </out> ( hazard ratio = 0.96 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.81 to 1.13 ; P = .589 ) or <out> progression-free survival </out> ( hazard ratio = 0.89 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.76 to 1.03 ; P = .128 ) . Only 69 % of patients received the three planned cycles of <int> MVP </int> . <out> Grade s 3 and 4 neutropenia </out> occurred in 16 % and 12 % , respectively , of patients in the <int> MVP </int> arm . Radiotherapy was completed by 65 % of patients in the <int> MVP </int> arm and by 82 % of patients in the control group .

Therefore , we conducted a r and omized trial to determine whether <int> postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy </int> is beneficial in <out> prolonging survival and decreasing recurrence </out> in <pop> patients with completely resected stage I NSCLC . </pop> METHODS It was design ed as a r and omized , prospect i ve two-armed study with <int> <pop> surgery only </int> ( control group , 59 patients ) </pop> versus <int> surgery plus <pop> adjuvant </pop> MVP ( mitomycin C , vinblastin and cisplatin ) <pop> chemotherapy </int> ( study group , 59 patients ) . </pop> RESULTS Data for all the patients were complete . <pop> Twenty-four patients </pop> in the <pop> control group </pop> and <pop> nine patients </pop> in the study group experienced <out> tumor recurrence </out> during the follow-up .

There was no clinical <out> significant morbidity </out> associated to chemotherapy <int> . </int> Patients were followed for a minimum period of 5 years . The <out> rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastases </out> were 18 and 30 % , respectively , in the <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> group and 24 and 43 % , respectively , in the <int> control </int> group . The <out> 5-year disease-free survival rates </out> were 59 % in the adjuvant group and 30 % in the control group ( P = 0.02 ) . The difference in the <out> Kaplan -- Meier survival </out> between the groups was significant as assessed using the log-rank test ( P = 0.04 ) . CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> may reduce <out> recurrences </out> and prolong <out> overall survival </out> in <pop> patients at stage IB NSCLC </pop> deemed radically operated . Despite being difficult to accept , the use of <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> might have better long-term results\", \"content\": null, \"publication_types\": [\"JournalArticle\",

However , subset analysis demonstrated that <int> PVM therapy </int> improved the <out> post operative survival </out> of <pop> pT1N0 patients </pop> ( the 5-year survival rate : 75.3 % for the surgery alone group , and 90.7 % for the chemotherapy group P<0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS It is interesting to find that among <pop> pT1N0 patients </pop> , who were not regarded as a target of chemotherapy , those receiving chemotherapy showed significantly better prognostic results .

The purpose of this study was to compare the <int> CAP </int> regimen with no treatment in <pop> patients with resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer . </pop> METHODS After complete resection , <pop> eligible patients with T1N1 or T2N0 non-small cell lung cancer </pop> were r and omly assigned to receive or not to receive four courses of <int> CAP </int> at 3-week intervals beginning on day 30 after surgery after stratification for histology , preoperative white blood cell count , and Karnofsky performance status before surgery .

chemotherapy </int> when given in addition to surgery , radical radiotherapy or \\' best supportive care \\' . However , it included many small trials and trials with differing eligibility criteria and chemotherapy regimens . The aim of the Big Lung Trial was therefore to run a large pragmatic trial to confirm the survival benefits seen in the meta- analysis . METHODS In the surgery setting , <pop> a total of 381 patients were r and omised to <int> chemotherapy </int> ( C , 192 patients ) or <int> no chemotherapy </int> ( NoC , 189 patients ) . </pop> C was three 3-weekly cycles of <int> cisplatin/vindesine , mitomycin/ifosfamide/cisplatin , mitomycin/vinblastine/cisplatin or vinorelbine/cisplatin . </int> RESULTS <int> Chemotherapy </int> was given before surgery in 3 % of patients whilst 97 % received <int> adjuvant chemotherapy . </int> Baseline characteristics were : median age 61 years , 69 % male , 48 % squamous cell , 93 % WHO PS 0 - 1 , 27 % stage I , 38 % stage II , and 34 % stage III . <out> Complete resection </out> was achieved in approximately 95 % of patients . In the C group , 13 % received <int> no chemotherapy </int> , 21 % one or two cycles , and 64 % all three cycles of their prescribed <int> chemotherapy </int> ( 60 % of the latter with no delays or modification ) . 30 % had grade <out> 3/4 toxicity , mainly haematological , nausea/vomiting and neutropenic fever </out> , and six patients were reported as having a <out> treatment-related death . </out> 198 ( 52 % ) of patients have <out> died </out> , but there is currently no evidence of a benefit in <out> overall survival </out> to the C group : HR 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.77 - 1.35 ) , P = 0.90 ) .

However , two studies of stage II and III disease by our Lung Cancer Study Group suggested an advantage to <int> adjuvant therapy </int> with <int> cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , and cisplatin ( CAP ) . </int> PURPOSE Since neither of those studies had an untreated control , the Lung Cancer Study Group undertook a trial that included a control group and also offered the potential benefit of <int> adjuvant therapy </int> with <int> CAP </int> to <pop> patients with T1 , N1 or T2 , N0 ( stage I ) non-small-cell lung cancer . </pop> METHODS After complete resection , <pop> eligible patients with stage I disease </pop> were classified <pop> by known prognostic factors </pop> and r and omly assigned to receive or not to receive four courses of <int> CAP </int> at 3-week intervals beginning on day 30 after surgery . The <int> CAP </int> regimen consisted of <int> 400 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide , 40 mg/m2 doxorubicin </int> , and <int> 60 mg/m2 cisplatin . </int> Stratification by prognostic factors was as follows : histology ( squamous versus nonsquamous ) , white blood cell count before surgery ( > or = 9100/mm3 versus < 9100/mm3 ) , and Karnofsky performance status before surgery ( < or = 90 % versus 100 % ) . RESULTS Of the <pop> 269 patients entered in the study </pop> , 101 had recurrence and 127 have died . Mean time since r <out> and </out> omization is 6.4 years ; mean follow-up is 3.8 years . There were no differences in <out> time to recurrence or overall survival </out> ( not stratified by histology ) between the two groups , even when analyses were adjusted for prognostic variables . There was one treatment-related <out> death </out> on the <int> CAP </int> arm due to <out> infection during neutropenia . </out> Only 53 % of the <pop> eligible </pop> patients received all four courses of <int> CAP </int> , and only 57 % of such patients received all four cycles on time . In 74 % of the patients , the site of initial <out> recurrence </out> was distant . CONCLUSIONS The most likely explanations for the lack of efficacy of <int> CAP </int> are poor compliance to the protocol and relative inactivity of the regimen , compared with the activity of drug combinations used in more recent studies . On the basis of this trial , <int> adjuvant therapy with CAP </int> should not be recommended for <pop> patients </pop> with <pop> resected stage I lung cancer . </pop> IMPLICATION S Further trials to test adjuvant therapy are indicated , but investigators should use better antiemetics to improve patient compliance as well as more active chemotherapy regimens\", \"content\": null,

of this study were to assess the effect of <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> on <out> overall survival , disease-free survival , and relapse pattern , as well as its toxicity </out> in <pop> patients who underwent radical surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . </pop> PATIENTS AND METHODS <pop> One hundred ten patients with T1 - 3N0 ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] 1981 ) NSCLC underwent <int> radical surgery </int> during the period of 1982 through 1987 . </pop> After surgery , the <pop> patients </pop> were r <pop> and omized </pop> to receive <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> ( n = 54 ) <int> ( cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 , doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 , and cisplatin 40 mg/m2 [ CAP ] for six cycles ) </int> or <int> no active treatment </int> ( n = 56 ) . RESULTS After 10 years from the start of the study , 61 % of patients were alive in the <int> chemotherapy </int> group and 48 % were alive in the control group ( P = .050 ) . Seventeen patients ( 31 % ) in the CAP group and 27 patients ( 48 % ) in the control group had a <out> recurrence </out> during the follow-up period ( P = .01 ) . The <out> 5-year survival rate </out> was 67 % in the chemotherapy group and was 56 % in the control group ( P = .050 ) . The patients in the chemotherapy group who completed the planned treatment had a slightly better <out> 5-year survival </out> than those whose chemotherapy was discontinued ( 72.5 % v 50.3 % ; P = .15 ) . <out> Chemotherapy-related gastrointestinal toxicity </out> grade 3 to 4 ( WHO ) occurred in 63 % and was the main reason why patients refused further planned therapy .

is now generally recommended after complete surgical resection for <pop> patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . </pop> We evaluated the results of the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial study with three additional years of follow-up . PATIENTS AND METHODS <pop> Patients with completely resected NSCLC </pop> were r and omly assigned to three or four cycles of <int> cisplatin-based chemotherapy </int> or to <int> observation . </int> Cox models were used to evaluate treatment effect according to follow-up duration . Results <pop> The trial included 1,867 patients with a median follow-up of 7.5 years . </pop> Results showed a beneficial effect of <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> on <out> overall survival </out> ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.91 ; 95 % CI , 0.81 to 1.02 ; P = .10 ) and on <out> disease-free survival </out> ( HR , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.78 to 0.98 ; P = .02 ) . However , there was a significant difference between the results of <out> overall survival </out> before and after 5 years of follow-up ( HR , 0.86 ; 95 % CI , 0.76 to 0.97 ; P = .01 v HR , 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 1.02 to 2.07 ; P = .04 ) with P = .006 for interaction . Similar results were observed for <out> disease-free survival . </out> The analysis of non-lung cancer deaths for the whole period showed an HR of 1.34 ( 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.81 ; P = .06 ) . CONCLUSION These results confirm the significant efficacy of <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> at 5 years . The difference in results beyond 5 years of follow-up underscores the need for the long-term follow-up of other adjuvant lung cancer trials and for a better identification of patients deriving long-term benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy\", \"content\": null, \"publication_types\": [\"JournalArticle\"], \"significances\": [{\"intervention\": \"no chemotherapy\", \"outcome\": \"risk of non-lung cancer-related death\", \"classification\": {\"significantly decreased\": 0.00017832507728599012, \"no significant difference\": 0.9987432360649109, \"significantly increased\": 0.0010784213664010167}, \"evidence_sentence\": \"The analysis of non-lung cancer deaths for the whole period showed an HR of 1.34 ( 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.81 ;

trials have investigated the effect of <int> adjuvant chemotherapy </int> in <pop> operable non-small-cell lung cancer . </pop> We undertook two comprehensive systematic review s and meta-analyses to establish the effects of adding <int> adjuvant chemotherapy to surgery , or to surgery plus radiotherapy . </int> Methods <pop> We </pop> included <pop> r and omised trials , not confounded by additional therapeutic differences between the two groups and that started r and omisation on or after Jan 1 , 1965 , which compared <int> surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone </int> , or <int> surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy versus surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy </pop> . </int> Up date d individual <pop> patient data </pop> were collected , checked , and included in meta-analyses stratified by trial . The primary endpoint was <out> overall survival </out> , defined as time from r and omisation until death by any cause . All analyses were by intention to treat . Findings The first meta- analysis of <int> surgery plus chemotherapy versus surgery alone </int> was based on <pop> 34 trial comparisons and 8447 patients ( 3323 deaths ) . </pop> We recorded a benefit of <int> adding <out> chemotherapy </int> </out> after surgery ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0\\\\u00b786 , 95 % CI 0\\\\u00b781\\\\u20130\\\\u00b792 , p<0\\\\u00b70001 ) , with an absolute <out> increase in survival </out> of 4 % ( 95 % CI 3\\\\u20136 ) at 5 years ( from 60 % to 64 % ) . The second meta- analysis of <int> surgery plus radiotherapy and chemotherapy versus surgery plus radiotherapy </int> was based on <pop> 13 trial comparisons and 2660 patients ( 1909 deaths ) . </pop> We recorded a benefit of <int> adding <out> chemotherapy </out> to <out> surgery plus radiotherapy </int> </out> ( HR 0\\\\u00b788 , 95 % CI 0\\\\u00b781\\\\u20130\\\\u00b797 , p=0\\\\u00b7009 ) , representing an absolute <out> improvement in survival </out> of 4 % ( 95 % CI 1\\\\u20138 ) at 5 years ( from 29 % to 33 % ) . In both meta-analyses we noted little variation in effect according to the type of chemotherapy , other trial characteristics , or patient subgroup . Interpretation The <int> addition of adjuvant chemotherapy </int> after surgery for <pop> patients with operable non-small-cell lung cancer <out> </pop> improves survival </out> , irrespective of

\"abstract\": \"BACKGROUND Although second primary cancers are a leading cause of death among <pop> men with testicular cancer </pop> , few studies have quantified risks among long-term survivors . METHODS <pop> Within 14 population -based tumor registries in Europe and North America ( 1943 - 2001 ) , we identified 40,576 1-year survivors of testicular cancer and ascertained data on any new incident solid tumors among these patients . </pop> We used <int> Poisson regression analysis </int> to model <out> relative risks ( RRs ) </out> and <out> excess absolute risks ( EARs ) </out> of second solid cancers . All statistical tests were two-sided . RESULTS A total of <pop> 2,285 second solid cancers were reported </pop> in the <pop> cohort . </pop> The <out> relative risk and EAR </out> decreased with increasing age at testicular cancer diagnosis ( P < .001 ) ; the <out> EAR </out> increased with attained age ( P < .001 ) but the <out> excess RR </out> decreased . Among 10-year survivors diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 35 years , the <out> risk of developing a second solid tumor </out> was increased ( RR = 1.9 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.8 to 2.1 ) . <out> Risk </out> remained statistically significantly elevated for 35 years ( RR = 1.7 , 95 % CI = 1.5 to 2.0 ; P < .001 ) . We observed statistically significantly elevated <out> risks </out> , for the first time , for cancers of the pleura ( malignant mesothelioma ; RR = 3.4 , 95 % CI = 1.7 to 5.9 ) and esophagus ( RR = 1.7 , 95 % CI = 1.0 to 2.6 ) . Cancers of <out> the </out> lung ( RR = 1.5 , 95 % CI = 1.2 to 1.7 ) , colon ( RR = 2.0 , 95 % CI = 1.7 to 2.5 ) , bladder ( RR = 2.7 , 95 % CI = 2.2 to 3.1 ) , pancreas ( RR = 3.6 , 95 % CI = 2.8 to 4.6 ) , and stomach ( RR = 4.0 , 95 % CI = 3.2 to 4.8 ) accounted for almost 60 % of the total excess . Overall patterns were similar for seminoma and nonseminoma patients , with lower risks observed for nonseminoma patients treated after 1975 . Statistically significantly increased <out> risks of solid cancers </out> were observed among patients treated with <int> radiotherapy </int> alone ( RR = 2.0 , 95 % CI = 1.9 to 2.2 ) , <int> chemotherapy </int> alone ( RR = 1.8 , 95 % CI = 1.3 to 2.5 ) , and both ( RR = 2.9 , 95 % CI = 1.9 to 4.2 ) . For patients diagnosed with seminomas or nonseminomatous tumors at age 35 years , <out> cumulative risks of solid cancer 40 years later </out> ( i.e. , to age 75 years ) were 36 % and 31 % , respectively , compared with 23 % for the general population . CONCLUSIONS <pop> Testicular cancer survivors </pop> are at statistically significantly increased <out> risk of solid tumors </out> for at least 35 years after treatment .

Cisplatin Evaluation was to identify treatment options associated with a higher benefit or groups of <pop> patients who particularly benefit from <int> postoperative chemotherapy . </int> </pop> PATIENTS AND METHODS Individual patient <pop> data </pop> were collected and pooled from the <pop> five largest trials ( 4,584 patients ) of <int> cisplatin-based chemotherapy </int> in completely resected patients that were conducted after the 1995 NSCLC meta- analysis . </pop> The interactions between patient subgroups or treatment types and chemotherapy effect on <out> OS </out> were analyzed using hazard ratios ( HRs ) and log-rank tests stratified by trial . RESULTS With a median follow-up time of 5.2 years , the <out> overall HR of death </out> was 0.89 ( 95 % CI , 0.82 to 0.96 ; P = .005 ) , corresponding to a 5-year absolute benefit of 5.4 % from chemotherapy . There was no heterogeneity of chemotherapy effect among trials . The <out> benefit </out> varied with stage ( test for trend , P = .04 ; HR for stage IA = 1.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.95 to 2.06 ; HR for stage IB = 0.93 ; 95 % CI , 0.78 to 1.10 ; HR for stage II = 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.73 to 0.95 ; and HR for stage III = 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.72 to 0.94 ) . The <out> effect of chemotherapy </out> did not vary significantly ( test for interaction , P = .11 ) with the associated drugs , including vinorelbine ( HR = 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.70 to 0.91 ) , etoposide or vinca alkaloid ( HR = 0.92 ; 95 % CI , 0.80 to 1.07 ) , or other ( HR = 0.97 ; 95 % CI , 0.84 to 1.13 ) . <out> Chemotherapy effect </out> was higher in <pop> patients with </pop> better performance status .

Retrospective analyses of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial and the Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation ( LACE ) meta- analysis suggest that the elderly benefit from <int> adjuvant chemotherapy . </int> However , the elderly were under-represented in these studies , raising concerns regarding the reproducibility of the study results in clinical practice . PATIENTS AND METHODS By <pop> using the Ontario Cancer Registry , we identified 6,304 patients with NSCLC who were treated with <int> surgical resection </int> from 2001 to 2006 . </pop> Registry data were linked to electronic treatment records . <out> Uptake of <int> chemotherapy </int> </out> was compared across <pop> age groups : younger than 70 , 70 to 74 , 75 to 79 , and \\\\u2265 80 years . </pop> As a proxy of survival benefit from <int> chemotherapy </int> , we compared survival of patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 with survival of those diagnosed from 2001 to 2003 <out> . Hospitalization </out> rates within 6 to 24 weeks of surgery served as a proxy <out> of severe chemotherapy-related toxicity </out> . RESULTS In all , <pop> 2,763 </pop> ( 43.8 % ) of <pop> 6,304 surgical patients </pop> were elderly ( age \\\\u2265 70 years <out> ) . Uptake <int> of adjuvant chemotherapy </int> </out> in <out> the </out> elderly increased from 3.3 % ( 2001 to 2003 ) to 16.2 % ( 2004 to 2006 ) . Among evaluable elderly patients , 70 % received <int> cisplatin </int> and 28 % received <int> carboplatin-based regimens . </int> Requirements for dose adjustments or drug substitutions were similar across age <out> groups . Hospitalization rates </out> within 6 to 24 weeks of surgery were similar across age groups ( 28.0 % for patients age < 70 years ; 27.8 % for patients age \\\\u2265 70 years ; P = <out> .54 ) . Four-year survival </out> of <out> elderly </out> patients increased significantly ( 47.1 % for patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2003 ; 49.9 % for patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 ; <out> P = .01 ) . Survival </out> improved in all subgroups except patients age \\\\u2265 80 years . <out> CONCLUSION Uptake <int> of adjuvant </out> chemotherapy </int> for NSCLC increased in <pop> patients age 70 years or older </pop> following reporting of pivotal adjuvant chemotherapy trials , but it remained below that for <pop> patients younger than age 70 years </pop> . <int> Adoption of adjuvant

For the T component , tumor size was found to have prognostic relevance , and its analysis led to recommendations to subclassify T1 tumors into T1a ( < or = 2 cm ) and T1b ( > 2 - < or = 3 cm ) and T2 tumors into T2a ( > 3 - < or = 5 cm ) and T2b ( > 5 - < or = 7 cm ) , and to reclassify T2 tumors > 7 cm into T3 . Furthermore , with additional nodules in the same lobe as the primary tumors , T4 tumors would be reclassified as T3 ; with additional nodules in another ipsilateral lobe , M1 as T4 ; and with pleural dissemination , T4 as M1 . There were no changes in the N category . In the M category , M1 was recommended to be subclassified into M1a ( contralateral lung nodules and pleural dissemination ) and M1b ( distant metastasis ) . The proposed changes for the new stage grouping were to upstage T2bN0M0 from stage IB to stage IIA , and to downstage T2aN1M0 from stage IIB to stage IIA and T4N0-N1M0 from stage IIIB to stage IIIA .

solitary adrenal metastasis from NSCLC and discuss its therapeutic role . METHODS <pop> From June 1993 to March 2003 , 14 patients ( pts ) , who had been undergone <int> lung resection </int> for NSCLC , with suspected or confirmed solitary adrenal gl and metastasis at the follow-up , underwent <int> 15 laparoscopic adrenalectomy </int> ( in 1 patient it was bilateral ) . </pop> All the <pop> patients had enlarged adrenal gl and s at </pop> the <pop> abdominal <int> ultrasound </int> or CT </pop> . All but <pop> 2 pts underwent </pop> at least 1 <int> adrenal <pop> fine </pop> needle aspiration . </int> All the patients underwent a careful staging to exclude other sites of metastasis . The adrenal gl and was in 6 cases the right , in 9 cases the left . RESULTS In 7 cases we had a preoperative <out> cytological diagnosis </out> of metastasis . In 1 case adrenalectomy was not performed because of infiltration of vena cava and in 1 case it was necessary to perform a small laparotomy because of bleeding <out> . </out> The pathologic examination confirmed in 11 cases a NSCLC metastasis while in 4 cases it was a cortical adenoma . Regarding the <pop> 10 patients </pop> with NSCLC metastases , 3 are still alive and well at 37 - 80 months from the lung resection .

Risk groups were defined using recursive partitioning analysis ( RPA ) . Analyses were conducted on training and validating sets ( two-thirds and one-third of patients , respectively ) . RESULTS <out> Median OS </out> was 26 months , 1-year OS 70.2 % , and 5-year OS 29.4 % . Surgery was the most commonly used treatment for the primary tumor ( 635 patients [ 83.9 % ] ) and metastases ( 339 patients [ 62.3 % ] ) . Factors predictive of <out> OS </out> were : <out> synchronous versus metachronous metastases </out> ( P < .001 ) , N-stage ( P = .002 ) , and <out> adenocarcinoma histology </out> ( P = .036 ) ; the model remained predictive in the validation set ( c-statistic = 0.682 ) . In RPA , 3 risk groups were identified : low-risk , metachronous metastases ( 5-year OS , 47.8 % ) ; intermediate risk , synchronous metastases and N0 disease ( 5-year OS , 36.2 % ) ; and high risk , synchronous metastases and N1/N2 disease ( 5-year OS , 13.8 % ) . CONCLUSION Significant <out> OS differences </out> were observed in <pop> oligometastatic patients </pop> stratified according to type of metastatic presentation , and N status . <out> Long-term survival </out> is common in selected patients with metachronous oligometastases . We propose this risk classification scheme be used in guiding selection of patients for clinical trials of ablative treatment',\n",

The aim of this study was to compare survival of <pop> patients who underwent <int> adrenalectomy </int> </pop> with <pop> those treated <int> nonoperatively </int> </pop> , and to analyze clinical characteristics associated with long-term survival . METHODS <pop> Between January 1994 and July 2010 , 37 patients with isolated adrenal metastasis from NSCLC were identified . Twenty patients underwent <int> adrenalectomy . </int> Patients did </pop> not undergo <int> <pop> adrenalectomy </int> </pop> owing to suspicion of <pop> N2 disease </pop> , <pop> medical comorbidities </pop> , or <pop> patient preference </pop> . Seven patients ( 35 % ) treated surgically had tumors that were ipsilateral to their primary tumor , and 8 ( 40 % ) had metachronous metastases . RESULTS <out> Five-year overall survival </out> was 34 % for patients treated operatively and 0 % for patients treated nonoperatively p = 0.002 ) . Among patients treated with <int> adrenalectomy </int> , patients with ipsilateral metastases had a <out> 5-year survival </out> of 83 % compared with 0 % for patients with contralateral metastases ( p = 0.003 ) .

For the T component , tumor size was found to have prognostic relevance , and its analysis led to recommendations to subclassify T1 tumors into T1a ( < or = 2 cm ) and T1b ( > 2 - < or = 3 cm ) and T2 tumors into T2a ( > 3 - < or = 5 cm ) and T2b ( > 5 - < or = 7 cm ) , and to reclassify T2 tumors > 7 cm into T3 . Furthermore , with additional nodules in the same lobe as the primary tumors , T4 tumors would be reclassified as T3 ; with additional nodules in another ipsilateral lobe , M1 as T4 ; and with pleural dissemination , T4 as M1 . There were no changes in the N category . In the M category , M1 was recommended to be subclassified into M1a ( contralateral lung nodules and pleural dissemination ) and M1b ( distant metastasis ) . The proposed changes for the new stage grouping were to upstage T2bN0M0 from stage IB to stage IIA , and to downstage T2aN1M0 from stage IIB to stage IIA and T4N0-N1M0 from stage IIIB to stage IIIA .

Prognostic variables were assessed using log-rank and Cox regression analyses . RESULTS For <pop> breast cancer patients </pop> , the median follow-up was 4.5 years ( 7.1 years for 16 of 39 patients alive at the last follow-up visit ) . The <out> 2-year OS , FFDM , and local control ( LC ) rate </out> was 74 % , 52 % , and 87 % , respectively . The <out> 6-year OS , FFDM , and LC rate </out> was 47 % , 36 % , and 87 % , respectively . From the multivariate analyses , the variables of bone metastases ( p = .057 ) and one vs. more than one metastasis ( p = .055 ) were associated with a fourfold and threefold reduced hazard of death , respectively . None of the 17 bone <out> lesions </out> from breast cancer <out> recurred </out> after <int> SBRT </int> vs. 10 of 68 lesions from other organs that recurred ( p = .095 ) . For <pop> patients with nonbreast cancers </pop> , the median follow-up was 1.7 years ( 7.3 years for 7 of 82 patients alive at the last follow-up visit ) . The <out> 2-year OS , FFDM , and LC rate </out> was 39 % , 28 % , and 74 % , respectively . The <out> 6-year OS , FFDM , and LC rate </out> was 9 % , 13 % , and 65 % , respectively . For nonbreast cancers , a greater <out> SBRT target volume </out> was significantly adverse for OS ( p = .012 ) and lesion LC ( p < .0001 ) .

METHODS The <pop> charts of 4668 patients who underwent <int> lung cancer surgery </int> from 1983 to 2006 </pop> were <pop> retrospectively review </pop> ed . We analysed the epidemiology , treatment , pathology and prognostic characteristics of those <pop> with extrathoracic synchronous solitary metastasis amenable to <int> lung cancer </pop> surgery </int> on a curative intend .

Pathology revealed adenocarcinomas ( n = 57 ) , squamous cell carcinoma ( n = 20 ) , large cell carcinoma ( n = 14 ) and other NSCLC histology ( n = 3 ) . <out> Lymphatic extension </out> was N0 ( n = 46 ) , N1 ( n = 17 ) and N2 ( n = 31 ) . <out> Metastasis </out> involved the brain ( n = 57 ) , adrenal gl and ( n = 12 ) , bone ( n = 14 ) , liver ( n = 5 ) and skin ( n = 6 ) . Sixty-nine metastases were resected . <out> Five-year survival rate </out> was 16 % ( median 13 months ) . Induction therapy , adenocarcinoma , N0 staging and lobectomy were criteria of better prognosis , but metastasis resection was not .

METHODS <pop> From June 1993 to March 2003 , 14 patients ( pts ) , who had been undergone <int> lung resection </int> for NSCLC , with suspected or confirmed solitary adrenal gl and metastasis at the follow-up , underwent <int> 15 laparoscopic adrenalectomy </int> ( in 1 patient it was bilateral ) . </pop> All the <pop> patients had enlarged adrenal gl and s at </pop> the <pop> abdominal <int> ultrasound </int> or CT </pop> . All but <pop> 2 pts underwent </pop> at least 1 <int> adrenal <pop> fine </pop> needle aspiration . </int> All the patients underwent a careful staging to exclude other sites of metastasis . The adrenal gl and was in 6 cases the right , in 9 cases the left . RESULTS In 7 cases we had a preoperative <out> cytological diagnosis </out> of metastasis . In 1 case adrenalectomy was not performed because of infiltration of vena cava and in 1 case it was necessary to perform a small laparotomy because of bleeding <out> . </out> The pathologic examination confirmed in 11 cases a NSCLC metastasis while in 4 cases it was a cortical adenoma . Regarding the <pop> 10 patients </pop> with NSCLC metastases , 3 are still alive and well at 37 - 80 months from the lung resection . One patient ( who underwent bilateral <int> adrenalectomy ) </int> is still <out> alive </out> at 44 months with local relapse . Two patients <out> died </out> 5 and 6 months after the <int> adrenalectomy </int> for other causes , 1 <out> died </out> at 14 months for local and systemic relapse and the remaining 3 patients <out> died </out> at 12 to 38 months for systemic relapse . CONCLUSIONS <int> Laparoscopic adrenalectomy </int> in patients resected for NSCLC is a safe mini-invasive procedure . Even though this series is still too small , <int> laparoscopic adrenalectomy </int> should be considered an effective therapeutic tool in case of progressive adrenal gl and enlargement , also with negative cytological examinations . A bigger series and other institution experiences will clarify its oncological value',\n",

We evaluate the POF in this setting to estimate the potential value of consolidative <int> stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . </int> Material s and methods . <pop> The records of consecutive NSCLC patients presenting to the University of Colorado , Denver ( UCD ) between January 2005 and June 2008 were review ed . Patients with measurable advanced stage NSCLC who received <int> first-line systemic therapy </int> and follow-up at UCD were eligible . </pop> In these patients , sites of disease at maximal response were evaluated for theoretical <int> SBRT </int> eligibility , based on institutional criteria .

However , some suggest that the survival outcome among patients with a synchronous <pop> metastasis </pop> is poor . It remains unclear whether this treatment approach is warranted among those with synchronous metastasis . METHODS A search for publications on <int> <pop> adrenalectomy </pop> for <pop> NSCLC </int> </pop> was performed via the MEDLINE data base . <pop> Studies reporting on survival outcomes and containing at least four analyzable patients who had <int> surgery </int> for primary lung cancer were included . </pop> Those not allowing separation of outcomes between synchronous and metachronous metastases were excluded . Synchronous metastasis was defined as a disease-free interval ( DFI ) of 6 months or less . RESULTS There were <pop> 10 publications contributing 114 patients ; 42 % of patients had synchronous metastases and 58 % had metachronous metastases . </pop> The <out> median DFIs </out> were 0 and 12 months , respectively . <pop> Patients in the synchronous group were younger than those in the metachronous group ( median age 54 v 68 years ) . <out> </pop> Complications from adrenalectomy </out> were infrequent . <out> Median overall survival </out> was shorter for patients with synchronous metastasis than those with metachronous metastasis ( 12 months v 31 months , generalized Wilcoxon P value = .02 ) .

CONCLUSION For an isolated adrenal metastasis from NSCLC , patients with a synchronous metastasis who underwent adrenalectomy had a shorter <out> median overall survival </out> than those with a metachronous metastasis . However , a durable <out> long-term survival </out> is achieved in approximately 25 % in both groups',\n",

Thirty-five ( 87 % ) had a single metastatic lesion . Thirty-seven ( 95 % ) of the patients <int> received chemotherapy </int> as part of their primary <out> treatment . Median overall survival ( OS ) </out> was 13.5 months ( 95 % confidence interval 7.6–19.4 ) ; 1- , 2- , and 3-year OS was 56.4 % , 23.3 % , and 17.5 % , <out> respectively . Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) </out> was 12.1 months ( 95 % confidence interval 9.6–14.3 ) ; 1-year PFS was 51.3 % , and both 2- and 3-year PFS was 13.6 % . Only two patients ( 5 % ) had <out> a local recurrence </out> . <out> No patient or tumor parameter , including volume and 18F-deoxyglucose uptake </out> was <out> significantly correlated with OS or PFS </out> . The treatment <out> was well tolerated </out> . Conclusion : In this phase II <out> study , long-term PFS </out> was found in a subgroup of NSCLC patients with synchronous oligometastases when treated radically . Identification of this favorable subgroup before therapy is needed',\n",

METHODS We have retrospectively analyzed the <pop> records </pop> of <pop> 53 patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who had been treated with curative <int> intent </int> in the period January 1997 to May 2010 . </pop> RESULTS <pop> The mean age and the male/female ratio were 61 years and 32:21 , respectively . </pop> A single metastatic lesion was present in 45 ( 84.9 % ) subjects , in 2 patients there were 2 different anatomic sites involved , and in 8 patients there were 2 metastases in the same site . The most common involved sites were brain ( 39 ) , followed by adrenal gl and ( 7 ) , bone ( 3 ) , vertebrae ( 3 ) , liver ( 1 ) , and contralateral supraclavicular lymph node ( 1 ) . Distant disease was completely resected in 42 patients ; 10 patients were treated with <int> exclusive chemotherapy and /or radiotherapy </int> and 1 with <int> local laser therapy . </int> Twenty-nine patients had been administered <int> concurrent chemoradiation </int> in a neoadjuvant setting before the surgical treatment at the lung or both sites ( primary /distant ) . The pulmonary resection was complete ( R0 ) in 42 patients ( 79.2 % ) .

The objective of this study is to clarify the <out> efficacy </out> of treatment and evaluate factors affecting <out> long-term patient survival . </out> METHODS <pop> We retrospectively review </pop> ed <pop> the medical charts of 70 patients found to have brain metastasis from NSCLC in Fukuoka University Hospital between 1994 and 2002 . </pop> These patients were grouped according to <int> therapy received for the brain and lung </int> and separated into two groups , as follows : LBR , <int> lung and brain resection ; </int> LR , <int> lung resection without brain resection . </int> We also evaluated these groups for a set of several factors . <out> Risk score </out> was calculated with reference to the data from multivariate analysis , which can estimate <out> survival . </out> RESULTS The number of <pop> patients who underwent <int> lung surgery plus brain surgery </int> was 41 . </pop> In this LBR , the <out> 1- and 3-year survival rates </out> after treatment of brain were 66.4 and 22.9 % , respectively . We found that a therapeutic strategy including <int> surgery for primary lung and brain </int> can afford patients an extended <out> survival time </out> compared to the survivals of other LR group . The <out> 3-year survival of </out> <pop> patients with high <out> carcinoembryonic antigen </out> ( CEA ) </pop> was 0 vs. 39.6 % among patients normal for CEA . Some factors , including <out> histological type , nodal metastasis , serum LDH and CEA </out> , were associated with survival . The multivariate Cox model identified both adenocarcinoma histological subtype , <out> node </out> status and <out> high serum CEA </out> as independent prognostic factors , whereas <out> serum LDH </out> was not found to be significant . <out> Risk score </out> was determined in our study to estimate prognosis according to the multivariate data . From this equation , previously we can expect 1- or 3-year <out> survival </out> of each patient with brain metastasis from NSCLC , refer to the risk score . CONCLUSIONS Stringent selection , i.e. low-risk score ( adenocarcinoma , node-negative and normal level of CEA ) of c and i date s for surgical treatment for primary lung and brain metastasis from NSCLC may be an acceptable and valuable approach',\n",

Seven <pop> patients </pop> underwent <int> chemotherapy </int> after <int> cerebral </int> procedure . <out> Pulmonary resection </out> was complete in 27 cases and incomplete in 4 . Histological findings showed : adenocarcinoma in 19 cases , squamous cell carcinoma in 8 and large cell carcinoma in 4 . All patients underwent <int> adjuvant chemotherapy . </int> Overall 1 , 2 and <out> 5-year survival rates </out> were 83 % , 47 % and 21 % , respectively . The <out> median survival </out> was 22 months .

Based on the GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates , about 12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated to have occurred in 2008 ; of these , 56 % of the cases and 64 % of the deaths occurred in the economically developing world . Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females , accounting for 23 % of the total cancer cases and 14 % of the cancer deaths . Lung cancer is the leading cancer site in males , comprising 17 % of the total new cancer cases and 23 % of the total cancer deaths . Breast cancer is now also the leading cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries , a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause of cancer death was cervical cancer . Further , the <out> mortality burden for lung cancer </out> among <pop> females </pop> in <pop> developing countries </pop> is as high as the burden for cervical cancer , with each accounting for 11 % of the total female cancer deaths . Although <out> overall cancer incidence rates </out> in the developing world are half those seen in the developed world in both sexes , the <out> overall cancer mortality rates </out> are generally similar <out> . Cancer survival </out> tends to be poorer in developing countries , most likely because of a combination of a late stage at diagnosis and limited access to timely and st and ard treatment .

Although classically considered incurable , various reports with small numbers of patients have shown that surgical treatment might improve <out> long-term survival . </out> The aim of this study was to review our experience and to identify factors that could affect survival <out> . </out> METHODS <pop> From January 1989 through April 2003 , 23 patients underwent <int> complete resection of an isolated adrenal metastasis after surgical treatment </int> of non-small cell lung cancer . There were 19 men and 4 women , with a mean age of 54 + /- 10 years . </pop> The diagnosis of adrenal metastasis was synchronous with the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer in 6 patients and metachronous in 17 patients . The <out> median disease-free interval </out> for patients with metachronous metastasis was 12.5 months ( range , 4.5 - 60.1 months ) . RESULTS The overall <out> 5-year survival </out> was 23.3 % . Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that a <out> disease-free interval </out> of greater than 6 months was an independent and significant predictor of increased <out> survival </out> in <pop> patients after <int> adrenalectomy . </int> </pop> All patients with a <out> disease-free interval </out> of less than 6 months <out> died </out> within 2 years of the operation . The <out> 5-year survival </out> was 38 % after resection of an isolated adrenal metastasis that occurred more than 6 months after lung resection . Adjuvant therapy and pathologic staging of non-small cell lung cancer did not affect survival <out> . </out> CONCLUSIONS <int> Surgical resection </int> of metachronous isolated adrenal metastasis with a <out> disease-free interval </out> of greater than 6 months can provide <out> long-term survival </out> in <pop> patients </pop> previously undergoing <pop> complete resection </pop> of the primary non-small cell lung cancer',\n",

Although resection of primary lung cancer and metachronous brain metastases is superior to other treatment modalities in prolonging <out> survival and disease-free interval </out> , resection of the primary non-small cell lung cancer and synchronous brain metastases is controversial . METHODS <pop> From January 1975 to December 1997 , 220 patients underwent <int> surgical treatment </int> for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer at our institution . Twenty-eight ( 12.7 % ) of these patients </pop> underwent <int> surgical resection </int> of synchronous brain metastases and the primary non-small cell lung cancer . RESULTS <pop> The group comprised 18 men and 10 women . Median age was 57 years ( range 35 - 71 years ) . Twenty-two ( 78.6 % ) patients had <out> neurologic symptoms . </out> Craniotomy </pop> was performed <pop> first </pop> in all <pop> 28 patients </pop> . Median time between craniotomy and thoracotomy was 14 days ( range 4 - 840 days ) . <int> Pneumonectomy </int> was performed in 4 patients , bilobectomy in 4 , lobectomy in 18 , and wedge <int> excision </int> in 2 . <out> Postoperative complications </out> developed in 6 ( 21.4 % ) patients . Cell type was adenocarcinoma in 11 patients , squamous cell carcinoma in 9 , and large cell carcinoma in 8 . After pulmonary resection , 17 patients had no evidence of lymph node metastases ( N0 ) , 5 had hilar metastases ( N1 ) , and 6 had mediastinal metastases ( N2 ) . Twenty-four ( 85.7 % ) patients received <int> postoperative adjuvant therapy . </int> Follow-up was complete in all patients for a median of 24 months ( range 2 - 104 months ) . <out> Median survival </out> was 24 months ( range 2 - 104 ) . <out> Survival </out> at 1 , 2 , and 5 years was 64.3 % , 54.0 % , and 21.4 % , respectively . The presence of thoracic lymph node metastases ( N1 or N2 ) significantly affected <out> 5-year survival </out> ( P = .001 ) . CONCLUSION Although the overall survival for <pop> patients who have brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer </pop> is poor , surgical <int> resection </int> may prove beneficial in a select group of patients with <pop> synchronous </pop> brain <pop> metastases and </pop> lung <pop> cancer </pop> without <pop> lymph node metastases </pop>',\n",

However , extended survival has been reported in <pop> patients presenting with a limited number of metastases , termed oligometastatic disease . </pop> We retrospectively review ed the outcomes of such patients treated at two centers . MATERIAL S AND METHODS <pop> From September 1999-July 2012 , a total of 61 patients with 1 - 3 synchronous metastases , who were treated with <int> radical intent </int> to all sites of disease , were identified from records of two cancer centers . </pop> Treatment was considered radical if it involved <int> surgical resection and /or delivery of radiation doses ≥13 × 3 Gy . </int> RESULTS Besides the primary tumor , <pop> 50 patients </pop> had a solitary metastasis , 9 had two metastases , and 2 had three metastases . Locations of metastases included the brain ( n = 36 ) , bone ( n = 11 ) , adrenal ( n = 4 ) , contralateral lung ( n = 4 ) , extra-thoracic lymph nodes ( n = 4 ) , skin ( n = 2 ) and colon ( n = 1 ) . Only one patient had metastases in two different organs . <out> Median follow-up </out> was 26.1 months ( m <out> ) , median overall survival ( OS ) </out> was 13.5 m , <out> median progression free survival ( PFS ) </out> was 6.6 m and <out> median survival after first progression </out> ( <out> SAFP ) </out> was 8.3 m . The 1- and 2-year OS were , 54 % and 38 % , respectively . Significant predictors of <out> improved OS </out> were : <out> smaller radiotherapy planning target volume ( PTV ) </out> ( p = 0.004 ) and surgery for the primary lung tumor ( p < 0.001 ) . Factors associated with <out> improved SAFP </out> included surgery for the primary lung tumor , presence of brain metastases , and absence of bone metastases . No significant differences in outcomes were observed between the two centers . CONCLUSION Radical treatment of <pop> selected NSCLC patients presenting with 1 - 3 synchronous metastases </pop> can result in <out> favorable 2-year survivals </out> . Favorable outcomes were associated with intra-thoracic disease status : patients with small radiotherapy treatment volumes or resected disease had the best OS . Future prospect i ve clinical trials , ideally r and omized , should evaluate radical treatment strategies in such patients',\n",

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis involving <pop> 12,395 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the pre-PET ( 1994 - 1998 ) and <int> PET </int> ( 1999 - 2004 ) periods . </pop> Interperiod differences in <out> staging procedures , clinical variables , and patient survival </out> were evaluated . RESULTS There was a 5.4 % decline in the number of <out> patients with stage III disease </out> and an 8.4 % increase in the number of patients with <out> stage IV disease </out> in the PET period , corresponding with an increase in <int> <out> PET </int> </out> use from 6.3 % to 20.1 % ( P < .001 ) . The PET period predicted better <out> survival </out> with a hazard ratio ( HR ) of 0.95 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.91 - 0.99 ) ( P = .02 ) . Use <out> of <int> PET </int> </out> was independently associated with <out> better survival </out> in patients with stage III ( HR , 0.77 ; 95 % CI , 0.69 - 0.85 ) and stage IV ( HR , 0.64 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 - 0.70 ) disease , but not those with stage I or II disease . CONCLUSION These data support the notion that stage migration is responsible at least in part for an apparent improvement in <out> survival </out> for <pop> patients with stage III and IV non-small cell lung cancer </pop> in the <int> PET scan </int> era',\n",

METHODS We performed a systematic review using PUBMED data base for <pop> all articles which included patients with NSCLC and solitary metastasis to sites other than the adrenal gl and or the brain who had undergone <int> resection of their metastasis and definitive treatment </int> of the primary lung cancer . </pop> Potential prognostic factors on survival including age , sex , histology , T and N stage of the primary tumor , synchronous vs. metachronous presentation , visceral vs. non-visceral metastasis and the use of perioperative <int> chemotherapy </int> were analyzed using multi-variable Cox proportional hazard model . RESULTS <pop> 62 cases were eligible for the analysis </pop> . The <out> 5-year survival rate </out> was 50 % for the entire cohort .
